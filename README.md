# Loan calculator

This program is crated as a credit calculator.

- Annuity. 
- Differentiated

With an annuity payment, the amount of the monthly contribution 
remains unchanged throughout the entire loan repayment period.

In case of differentiated payment, the loan body is repaid monthly 
in equal shares, and the interest accrued for the current month is 
also paid. Thus, at the beginning of the loan repayment period, 
the payment amounts are maximum, and at the end of the term - minimum.
